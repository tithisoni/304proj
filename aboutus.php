            <h3>The Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Spending time in my garden gave me a sense of peace, and in the hopes of helping others find the same peace as me, I cultivated and created flora that would bring charm and a sense of wonder to your home!</p>

            <h3>The Goal</h3>
            <p>My goal is to help you find peace in your life by building your own garden of Eden. With these one of a kind flora and fauna, it will take your garden to the next level. Finish it off with high-quality and gorgeous furnishings and voila! Luckily you won't be forced to leave this garden for eating forbidden fruit!</p>
